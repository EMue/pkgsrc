This package provides the necessary header files and libraries to
install NetBSD utilities and libraries on Solaris 2.6, and has been
used to get the NetBSD packages collection working on Solaris.  It was
developed by Christos Zoulas, and has been tested on Solaris 2.6,
running on Sparc hardware.

To get this package running on Solaris, you'll need to have either
a recent gcc or egcs installed, and a version of GNU tar available,
as well as gzip.

After extracting all the files, you need to edit Makefile.inc to set
the correct paths for ${BSDSRCDIR} (where the NetBSD src tree is
located), and for ${DESTDIR} (where the binaries and support files
will be placed). Then, make sure that /usr/ccs/bin is in your path,
and then invokde Solaris' make (/usr/ccs/bin/make).
