To activate the LPRng printing system do the following:
	- set `lpd=NO' in /etc/rc.conf
	- run ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/lprng.sh (may be added to /etc/rc.local)
	- remember to adjust your aliases or your PATH to use the new programs

Note that LPRng uses:
	/etc/printcap
	/etc/lpd_printcap
	/etc/lpd.conf
	/etc/lpd.perms
