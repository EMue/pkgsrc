To customize AUC TeX you will need to edit the file `tex-site.el' in
the site-lisp directory (${PREFIX}/share/emacs/site-lisp).  Add the
parts of `tex.el' (in the `auctex' subdirectory) which need to be
changed to `tex-site.el'. This way you can keep your customizations
and they will not get deleted when you update to a newer version of
AUC TeX.

You may then put

	(require 'tex-site)

in you .emacs.el file.
