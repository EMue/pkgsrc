You should be able to select this version of Qt when compiling
programs which use it by doing the following:

*  Use the following "configure" arguments:
      "--with-qt-includes=${X11BASE}/include/qt2/"
      "--with-qt-libraries=${X11BASE}/lib/qt2/"

*  Put ${X11BASE}/bin/qt2 in your PATH and/or set the environment
   variable MOC to ${X11BASE}/bin/qt2/moc

To access Qt-2 man pages add ${X11BASE}/man/qt2 to your MANPATH
environment variable.  Note that the Qt-2 man pages are installed
here to avoid conflicts with the Qt-1 man pages.
