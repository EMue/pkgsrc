So, what does XPaint do for you?  Why many wonderful things of
course.  XPaint is a reasonably versatile bitmap/pixmap editing
tool.  XPaint came out of a problem editing some very large bitmaps,
and wanting more functionality then was provided by bitmap. After
XPaint 1.0 sat around for a LONG time, I finally ended up with a
strong need to edit color pixmaps.  Presto, this is what has appeared
from that problem.

The short features list:
	Usual paint operations:
		Brushes, Spray paint, Pencil
		Lines, Arcs, Pattern Fill, Text,
		Boxes, Circles, Polygons.
	Works on multiple images simultaneously.
	Cut/Copy/Paste between all active images.
	Fatbits/Zoom on the image windows.
