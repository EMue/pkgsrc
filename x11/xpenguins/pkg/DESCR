XPenguins is a simple program that animates a number of penguins that
fall from the top of the screen, walk along the top of windows, up
the side of windows, up the side of the screen, and sometimes even
levitate with their genetically-modified go-go-gadget 'copter
ability.

Version 2 is themeable, so if you're bored of penguins you can try
`xpenguins --theme "Turtles"' to get some nice turtles images
(by Mayuko Nagata), or download some extra themes. Most of the default
penguin images were taken from Pingus, a free lemmings clone for Linux,
although more have been created for XPenguins version 2.
