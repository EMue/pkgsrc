  Gtk-- is a C++ interface for C++ wrapper for the gimp toolkit, a set
of libraries for building complex X11 user interfaces, used by, e.g.,
Gimp and Gnome.  Gtk-- provides a convenient interface for C++
programmers to create graphical user interfaces with Gtk's flexible
OO framework.

  Highlights include type safe callbacks, widgets extensible using
inheritance and over 110 classes that can be freely combined to quickly
create complex user interfaces.
