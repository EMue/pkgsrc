FIRST TIME USERS:
To use afterstep, put "exec afterstep" at the end of your .xinitrc
or .xsession file, as applies, commenting out any line(s) for your
current window manager.


UPGRADERS:
The format of many of the config files may change with the minor
version number, as from 1.5.x to 1.6.10. Upgraders are advised to
back up their old custom configs,
"cp ~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep ~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep.old",
review the defaults in ~/usr/X11R6/share/afterstep for compatibility,
and edit as required before moving them back.


EVERYBODY:
Try the AfterStep Control Panel (available as a separate package,
x11/ascp) for configuring AfterStep.

If the "Afterstep Documentation" item in the default start menu
fails to work, it's probably because you don't have a binary called
either "netscape" or "lynx" on your system.  With your favorite
browser, try

	file://usr/X11R6/share/afterstep/doc/afterstep.html
