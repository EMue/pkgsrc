racoon speaks IKE (ISAKMP/Oakley) key management protocol, to
establish security association with other hosts.

Known issues:
- cannot negotiate SA bundle, like "AH + ESP".
- too many usage of dynamic memory allocation, which leads to memory leak.
- non-threaded implementation.  simultaneous key negotiation performance
  should be improved.
- cryptic configuration syntax - blame IPsec specification too...

Bug reports should be sent to http://orange.kame.net/dev/send-pr.html.
