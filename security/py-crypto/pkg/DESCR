This is version 1.0.0 of the Python Cryptography Toolkit, a
collection of cryptographic routines for the Python programming
language, written by Andrew Kuchling <andrewk@cst.ca>

The PCT is a collection of secure hash functions (such as MD5
and SHA), and various encryption algorithms (IDEA, DES, RSA, ElGamal,
etc.). The package is structured to make adding new modules easy.

One possible application of the PCT is writing secure administration
tools. Another application is in writing daemons and servers. Clients
and servers can encrypt the data being exchanged and mutually
authenticate themselves; daemons can encrypt private data for added
security. Python also provides a pleasant framework for prototyping and
experimentation with cryptographic algorithms; thanks to its
arbitrary-length integers, public key algorithms based on number theory
are easily implemented. 

See pct.info for more information.
