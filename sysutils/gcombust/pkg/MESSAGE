=============================================================================

  The gcombust package is now installed.  Please note that this package
uses cdrecord for writing CDs.  Therefore, you may want to adjust
/dev/su0-6-0 to point to your system's CD-R device (default: /dev/cd0d):

	ln -s /dev/cd0d /dev/su0-6-0
