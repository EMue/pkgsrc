The default NetBSD/sparc /usr/lib/c++rt0.o is compiled -fpic. This
means it can only handle offsets up to a certain size, and can fail
to work in large programs. Compiling -fPIC allows larger offsets
and should permit large programs to function.

This package allows most of pkgsrc on NetBSD/sparc systems before the
1.4.3 release (which already contains this fix).
