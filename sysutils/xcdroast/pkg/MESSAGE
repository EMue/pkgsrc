xcdrgtk (aka xcdroast) creates its config file into
${PREFIX}/etc/xcdroast.conf. It will not get removed with pkg_delete(1)
automatically. So if you no longer intend to use this package don't
forget to remove it by hand.
xcdrgtk doesn't work as SUID program if linked against gtk-1.2.9. Other
options include making cdrecord SUID or using a wrapper like sudo.
