+**
+**      This version of the stream object just writes to a socket.
+**      The socket is assumed open and closed afterward.
+**
+**      There are two versions (identical on ASCII machines)
+**      one of which converts to ASCII on output.
+**
+**      Bugs:
+**              strings written must be less than buffer size.
