You will need to generate certificates and keys for your server before
Apache will start with mod_ssl support.  Please read

	${PREFIX}/share/doc/mod_ssl/README.mkcert

for more information on how to do this.

In order to start Apache with mod_ssl support, you need to run Apache
with "apachectl startssl" instead of "apachectl start".  The SSL-specific
configuration parts of the default httpd.conf are bracketed by:

  <IfDefine SSL>
  </IfDefine>
