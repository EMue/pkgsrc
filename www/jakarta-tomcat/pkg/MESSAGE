Tomcat can be started and stopped with the following commands:

	cd @TOMCAT_HOME@ && ./startup.sh
	cd @TOMCAT_HOME@ && ./shutdown.sh

By default, this will start the Tomcat webserver on port 8080

To get Tomcat working with Apache Server quickly, install the
ap-jserv package and add the following line to your httpd.conf:

	Include @TOMCAT_HOME@/etc/tomcat.conf

and make sure that apache and tomcat are not set to run on the
same http port, and that jserv.conf from mod_jserv is not also
included.
