For detailed instructions on how to run Tomcat, either as a
standalone server or in conjunction with Apache (using the
www/ap-jserv package), see:

	${TOMCAT_HOME}/doc/uguide/tomcat_ug.html

For more information on application development with Tomcat, see

	${TOMCAT_HOME}/doc/appdev/index.html

Note also that in order for Tomcat to start up, ${JAVA_HOME}
must point to your JVM installation.
