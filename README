Welcome to the NetBSD Packages System
=====================================

Below this directory, you will find packages to build (compiled) programs
from sources. To do so, cd into one of the sub-directories, and enter:

	make
	make install

To make a precompiled binary package that can be installed on another
system, enter

	make package

after that. The precompiled package will be placed in the "packages" 
subdirectory. A collection of precompiled binary packages can be found
on ftp.netbsd.org in /pub/NetBSD/packages. To install a precompiled 
binary package, hand it's filename or an ftp://-URL pointing to it to
pkg_add(1).

See http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/netbsd/Packages.txt for more
information on the packages system.
