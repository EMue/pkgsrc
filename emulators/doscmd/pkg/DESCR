doscmd, an MS-DOS emulator (NetBSD/i386 only)

Doscmd simulates an MS-DOS environment for running DOS software. Rather
than provide a software emulation of the 8086 CPU, it uses the
NetBSD/i386 system call i386_vm86() call using the VM86 mode of i386 and
later CPUs, so it runs much more quickly, at the cost of not running on
other architectures.
