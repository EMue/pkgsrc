X-Mame the UNIX/X11 port of Mame project.  It makes Mame arcade emulator
available on *ix machines using the X11R6 X-Window system ( and Linux ones
using SVGAlib too )

Mame is a virtual machine emulator: it includes a Z80, 6502 and lastly I86
uP emulators, joined to several arcade machine hardware emulators. Each
arcade emulator contains a full description about hardware, mem maps,
video, sounds and so, making possible that if you have original ROM images
of a supported arcade game, you can play the game. 

You NEED the rom images to play a game: this is not a game emulator, just
an arcade machine one.

be distributed in the same package as Mame. Download them at your
