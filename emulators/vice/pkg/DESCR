VICE is a Versatile Commodore Emulator, i.e. a program that runs on a Unix
or MS-DOS/Windows 95 machine and executes programs intended for the old
8-bit Commodore computers. The current version emulates the C64, the C128
(save the 80 columns screen), the VIC20, the CBM-II line (B128, B256), and
all the PET models (except the SuperPET 9000, which is out of line
anyway).
