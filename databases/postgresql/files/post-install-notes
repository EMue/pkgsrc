Now that PostgreSQL is installed, you should read the documentation and
implementation guides. These can be found at:

		http://www.PostgreSQL.org/docs

You may wish to subscribe to the PostgreSQL user-support mailing list.
Send an e-mail to pgsql-questions-request@postgresql.org with the
text "subscribe" in the message body.

If you built PostgreSQL with TCL support, then you can use the
TCL/TK based database frontend "pgaccess" for database operations.
