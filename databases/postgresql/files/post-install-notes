Now that PostgreSQL is installed, you should read the documentation and
implementation guides. These can be found at:

		http://www.PostgreSQL.org/docs/

You may wish to subscribe to the PostgreSQL user-support mailing list.
Send an e-mail to pgsql-questions-request@postgresql.org with the
text "subscribe" in the message body.

If you built PostgreSQL with Tcl/Tk support, then you can also install
the Tcl/Tk database frontend "pgaccess" (databases/pgaccess) for database
operations with a GUI.
