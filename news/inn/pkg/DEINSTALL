Note that the inn spool directory (/var/spool/news) and log directory
(/usr/pkg/log) are NOT deleted by the pkg_delete process.  Please remove
these directories and all their contents manually, if they are no longer
needed. Files in /usr/pkg/etc have not been deleted either, if you wish
to remove them you will need to do so manually as well.
