   Festival is an advanced multi-lingual speech synthesis system
   developed at CSTR. It offers a full text to speech system with
   various APIs, as well an environment for development and research
   of speech synthesis techniques. It is written in C++ with a
   Scheme-based command interpreter for general control.

You will also need to install at least one festvox-* (festival voice)
package (infact, the festvox packages are dependent on this package).

  festival --tts foo.bar will speak ASCII file foo.bar, 
  (SayText "Oh Dad! We're ALL Devo!")
