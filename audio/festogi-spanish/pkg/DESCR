DESCRIPTION
-----------

OGIspanish is an extension to the Festival TTS system
(http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival).  This version of
OGIspanish has been designed to work with Festival version 1.4.0
released June 1999.  It provides Mexican Spanish voices created by OGI
staff and Alejandro Barbosa from UDLA, Puebla, Mexico.

The module is distributed in three chunks:
 1) OGIspanish-2.0.tar.gz -- Scheme code
 2) voice_hvs-2.0.tar.gz -- female voice
 3) voice_abc-2.0.tar.gz -- male voice

New in this release (2.0):
	* works with Festival 1.4.0
	
	* intonation module accepts parameter that allows base f0 to be
	  modified in the same manner as the English voices in the context
	  of the CSLU Toolkit

	* major improvements to the tokenization module
		- accents 'vowel format abandoned
		- now use vowel' to indicate accent on non-Spanish keyboard
		- tilde can be entered as n~ or ny
		- dieresis supported
		- Spanish keyboard special characters supported
		- a host of Abbreviations added
		- improved processing of money, temperature, etc.

	* intonation module: At the highest level of the intonation module 
	  is a new stage to incorporate different phrase intonation models. 

	* new syllabification function for Mexican Spanish. This function 
          uses lexical rules to syllabify and accentuate in Spanish and 
          solves both syllabification and stress prediction at word level.

	* new function for duration prediction for Spanish that works at 
	  the syllable level and differs a little from the duration 
	  prediction modules offered by festival.

Notes:

1) Currently, the Mexican Spanish voice does not support Spanish
characters such as tilded vowels, ˜ or dierisis. You must enter 
them as follows: 

tilded a	-	a'
tilded e	-	e'
tilded i	-	i'
tilded o	-	o'
tilded u	-	u'
tilded n	-	n~
