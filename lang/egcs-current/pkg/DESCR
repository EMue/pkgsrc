This version of egcs, Cygnus's own gcc, is a snapshot release.  That means
the source is experimental, and not heavily tested. 

The egcs compiler includes gcc (the GNU C compiler), g++ (the GNU C++
compiler), g77 (the GNU FORTRAN 77 compiler), and libstdc++ (the GNU ANSI
C++ library).  Currently, a shared C++ library is only available for a.out
platforms (this is being worked on).
