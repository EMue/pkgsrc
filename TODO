pksgrc TODO (Suggested pkgsrc features and enhancements)
^^^^^^^^^^^

	o Add a default test target to mk/*.mk and override it in any pkgs
	  that have testsuites. Use it in bulk builds/test.

	o Add a USE_PTHREADS variable with ALT_PTHREADS override.

	o Add a sort check to pkglint for PLISTs.

	o Add a method to provide distfile-specific MASTER_SITES  [PR pkg/7471]

	o Make pkgsrc work under HP-UX. (10.20, I mean)  I (IMHO) finised the
	  modifying for bsd.pkg.mk and will commit that after freeze.  The
	  remaining and harder part is to make the cross-environment for HP-UX.
