.TH "sp2sp" "1" 
.SH "NAME" 
sp2sp \(em translate from one spice-type analog waveform file format to another 
.iX "spice" "file" 
.iX "waveform" 
.SH "SYNOPSIS" 
.PP 
\fBsp2sp\fP [-c \fIoutput-format\fP]  [-f \fIfieldnamelist\fP]  [-n \fIfieldnumberlist\fP]  [-t \fIinput-format\fP]  [-v] \fIfilename\fP  
.SH "Description" 
.PP 
\fBsp2sp\fPtranslates analog waveform data, such as that 
produced by \fBspice\fP, from one format to another. 
Several input and output formats are supported.  In addition,  
a subset of the variables in the input file can be selected to appear 
in the output. 
 
.PP 
If no \fIfilename\fP is specified, \fBsp2sp\fP reads from the standard input. 
Translated results are always sent to standard output. 
 
.PP 
\fBsp2sp\fP accepts the following options: 
 
.IP "-c \fIoutput-format\fP" 10 
Sets the format for the output file.  Available formats include 
ascii, nohead, and cazm. 
.IP "-f \fIfieldnamelist\fP" 10 
A list of field names, seperated by commas.  Only the fields matching the specified 
names are included in the output.  Field names comparisons are case-insensitive. 
If a field name does not match exactly, sp2sp also looks for the field name with "v(" 
prepended, to allow for the tendancy of \fBHSpice\fP to list voltages 
this way in transient simulation output. 
.IP "-n \fIfieldnumberlist\fP" 10 
A list of field numbers, seperated by commas.  The independent variable, for example 
the time axis of a transient simulation, is field number zero. 
.IP "-t \fIinput-format\fP" 10 
Sets the expected format for input file or standard input.  Input formats  
supported include: cazm and hspice. 
.IP "-v" 10 
Turns on verbose mode to print detailed information about the input file.      
.SH "FILE FORMATS SUPPORTED" 
.PP 
A number of file formats are supported by \fBsp2sp\fP, 
with more to be added in the future.   Note that some formats are 
only supported for input or output; this asymetry should also be corrected 
where possible. 
 
.IP "ascii" 10 
A simple tabular ascii format, with column headings.  Note that files 
in this format may have very long lines.  Available for output only. 
.IP "nohead" 10 
Supported for output only, this format is similar to the 
ascii format, except that there are no column headings. 
This format is most useful for feeding into other unix 
utilities, such as awk, for specialized postprocessing. 
.IP "cazm" 10 
This format, generated by the CAzM simulator, is accepted for 
input and output.  It is essentialy the same as "ascii" except for its header. 
.IP "hspice" 10 
The formats produced by \fBHSpice\fP, from 
transient, sweep, and AC analyses are supprorted for input only. 
Both the ascii and binary subformats are supported for reading and 
are automaticly detected.      
.SH "EXAMPLES" 
.PP 
 
.SH "BUGS" 
.PP 
For input file formats that support multiple sets of waveforms in the same file, 
only the first one is recognized and translated.
