# Usage: pkgvi file
#
# The pkgvi utility runs user's favourite editor (it uses $PKG_EDITOR if
# defined, then it looks for $EDITOR, if none is defined, it uses vi) on
# copy of specified file. If no changes are made in the editor, nothing
# happens, else original file is stored as $filename.orig, and modified
# file is saved as $filename. If it founds $filename.orig, it behaves as
# normal editor.
#
