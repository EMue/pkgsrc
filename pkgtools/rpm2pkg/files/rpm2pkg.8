.Sh NAME
.Nm rpm2pkg
.Nd RPM to BSD package convertion helper
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d Ar directory
.Op Fl f Ar package_list
.Op Fl i Ar ignored_dir
.Op Fl p Ar prefix
.Ar rpm_file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
helps building BSD packages from RPM files by unpacking each specified
.Ar rpm_file, 
and by building a 
.Ar package_list
according to what was extraced. The
.Ar packge_list
has the format expected by the NetBSD package system.
.Pp 
.Nm 
also provide a mecanism that helps selecting what is actually 
extracted from the RPM files. It is therefore possible to reject files
that are of no interest when building a BSD package. This is specially usefull for files that are to be extracted in
.Pa /var
or
.Pa /etc
directories.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d Ar directory
Change working directory to 
.Ar directory
.It Fl f Ar packge_list
Produce a NetBSD package list 
.Ar packge_list
from what was actually extracted from the RPM files archives.
.It Fl i Ar ignored_dir
Do not extract files contained in the
.Ar ignored_dir
directory of the RPM files archives.
.It Fl p Ar prefix
Use 
.Ar prefix 
when extracting files.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Nm
.Fl d Ar /usr/pkg
.Fl f Ar /usr/pkgsrc/emulator/more_linux_lib/work/PLIST_DYNAMIC
.Fl p Ar emul/linux
.Fl i Ar tmp
.Fl i Ar var
.Fl i Ar usr/tmp
.Ar /usr/pkgsrc/distfiles/more_linux_lib/foo.rpm 
.Ar /usr/pkgsrc/distfiles/more_linux_lib/bar.rpm
.Pp
This will extract 
.Pa foo.rpm 
and
.Pa bar.rpm
into 
.Pa /usr/pkg/emul/linux.
A Packing list, called 
.Pa PLIST_DYNAMIC
will be created, with pathnames relative to 
.Pa /usr/pkg,
because this is the directory we asked 
.Nm
to change to with the
.Fl d
option.
.Pp
.Nm 
will not extract files contained in the
.Pa tmp,
.Pa var,
and
.Pa /usr/tmp
directories of the RPM files archives.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
.Nm 
should work with any regular RPM file.
