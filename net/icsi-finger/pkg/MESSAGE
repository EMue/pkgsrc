This is the NetBSD package for ICSI-finger, a more advanced version of
GNU finger.

This needs a log of configuration to be useful. Therefore it isn't activated
when installed.

You'll find example configuration files in
/usr/pkg/share/examples/icsi-finger and
/usr/pkg/share/examples/icsi-finger/targets, and are strongly advised
to read the gfingerd and cfingerd man pages.

Also, if you activate the package, you'll need to append 
/usr/pkg/share/examples/icsi-finger/inetd.conf-add to /etc/inetd.conf,
/usr/pkg/share/examples/icsi-finger/services-add to /etc/services, and
(on the master finger server) 
/usr/pkg/share/examples/icsi-finger/rc.local-add to /etc/rc.local.
