If you don't already have a FQDN with dhis.org domain, you will need to
register at http://www.dhis.org/dhis/register.html.

You will need to setup /usr/pkg/etc/dhid.conf with settings for
`idnumber', `fqdn', and `password' with your DHIS-provided host id
number, FQDN with dhis.org domain, and update password, respectively.
You receive these values when registerring with dhis.org, see above.
