The Multi Router Traffic Grapher is now installed.  Do note that three
programs have changed names to more readily reflect their MRTG-specific
function; make sure to prefix them with "mrtg":

    cfgmaker -> mrtgcfgmaker
    indexmaker -> mrtgindexmaker

The documentation can be found at @PREFIX@/share/doc/mrtg/manual.html;
there is a .txt version there as well.

A sample config file collecting various datas from a NetBSD machine can
be found in @PREFIX@/etc/mrtg/.
