README for NOCOL/NetConsole v4.2
===========================

NOCOL/NetConsole (Network Operation Center On-Line) is a network monitoring 
package that runs on Unix platforms and is capable of monitoring network and
system variables such as ICMP or RPC reachability, RMON variables,
nameservers, ethernet load, port reachability, host performance, SNMP traps,
modem line usage, appletalk & novell routes/services, BGP peers, syslog
files, etc. The software is extensible and new monitors can be added easily.

The software consists of a number of individual, standalone monitoring agents
that poll the various network and system parameters and put it into a common
data format.  All the monitors have a common display and postprocessing
interface (such as logging, notification, etc.). The design allows running
just one set of monitoring agents and *any* number of display agents, and all
of the displays see the same consistent set of data. Additionally, each event
is assigned a severity (determined by comparing against user defined threshold
values) which is gradually escalated, thus preventing false alarms and a
customized priority notification based on the severity. There are four
severity levels ranging from Critical thru Info, and each event typically
steps through each one of these severities until it reaches its maximum
allowed level.

The display uses UNIX 'curses' screen management and can thus run on a large
variety of terminals. The user running the display can select the minimum
display severity- only events above this minimum severity level are displayed.

A Web interface has also been added which uses the HTML REFRESH meta tag for
displaying the nocol events.

To date, the various monitoring agents developed are:

	- IP ICMP monitor (using IP 'multiping')
	- OSI reachability monitor (using OSI ping)
	- RPC portmapper monitor (using 'rpcping')
	- Ethernet load (bandwidth & pps)
	- TCP port monitor
	- Unix host performance (disks, memory, swap, load, nfs, collisions)
	- SNMP variables monitor (RMON, Cisco router, terminal server)
	- TCP data throughput monitor
	- Nameserver (named)
	- SNMP traps
	- Syslog logfile monitor (for specified patterns)
	- NTP stratum of hosts (Network Time Protocol)
	- UPS (APC) battery level monitor
	- Usage of terminal server modem lines (busy lines)
	- Appletalk route monitor (for cisco routers)
	- Novell service monitor
	- BGP peer status
	
A PERL interface is available for developing additional monitors in the PERL
programming language (it is fairly easy to add additional monitors to the
package).

The logging daemon can be interfaced with a paging program such as
'sendpage' (ftp://ftp.net.ohio-state.edu/pub/pagers/).

New features in v4.2 are:
------------------------

 - Unix syslog file monitor (match any specified regular expression)
 - NTP (Network Time Protocol) stratum monitor
 - 'mailmon' merged in with 'hostmon-client'
 - 'nsmon' can monitor multiple domains
 - 'apcmon' for monitoring APC Smart UPS's
 - 'ciscomon' for monitoring Cisco router specific parameters
 - Web interface for displaying events (www/webnocol)

New features in v4.0 were:

 - Unix host performance monitor (distributed client)
 - SNMP variables monitor
 - Ethernet load and packet rate monitor.
 - 'rpcpingmon' for checking status of RPC on hosts.
 - 'logstats' for generating reports from the log file.
 - Major rewrite of large portions of the code.

New features in v3.0 were:

 - Logging facility (similar to syslogd)
 - Perl interface
 - TCP port monitor
 - Perl appletalk, Novell, BGP, modem line monitors.

Has been compiled on Solaris2.2, SunOS4.1.1, Ultrix4.2, BSDI/386. Linux.
