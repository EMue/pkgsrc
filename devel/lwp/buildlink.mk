# This Makefile fragment is included by packages that use lwp.
#
# To use this Makefile fragment, simply:
#
# (1) Optionally define LWP_REQD to the version of lwp desired.
# (2) Include this Makefile fragment in the package Makefile,
# (3) Optionally define BUILDLINK_INCDIR and BUILDLINK_LIBDIR,
# (4) Add ${BUILDLINK_TARGETS} to the prerequisite targets for pre-configure,
# (5) Add ${BUILDLINK_INCDIR} to the front of the C preprocessor's header
#     search path, and
# (6) Add ${BUILDLINK_LIBDIR} to the front of the linker's library search
#     path.
